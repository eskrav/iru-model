abstract = {We explore the role of redundancy, both in anticipation of and in response to listener confusion, in task-oriented dialogue. We find that direction-givers provide redundant utterances in response to both verbal and non-verbal signals of listener confusion. We also examine the effects of prior ac- quaintance and visibility upon redundancy. As expected, givers use more redundant ut- terances overall, and more redundant utter- ances in response to listener questions, when communicating with strangers. We discuss our findings in relation to theories of redundancy, the balance of speaker and listener effort, and potential applications.},

abstract = {A number of recent proposals have used techniques from game theory and Bayesian cog- nitive science to formalize Gricean pragmatic reasoning [29, 28, 36, 51]. In the first part of this work, we discuss several phenomena which pose a challenge to these accounts of prag- matics: M-implicatures [45] and embedded implicatures which violate Hurford's constraint [49, 16]. While techniques have been developed for deriving M-implicatures, Hurford- violating embedded implicatures pose a more fundamental challenge to the models' archi- tecture. In order to explain these phenomena, we propose that the semantic content of an utterance is not fixed independent of pragmatic inference; rather, pragmatic inference par- tially determines an utterance's semantic content. We show how semantic inference can be realized as an extension to the Rational Speech Acts framework [36]. The addition of lexi- cal uncertainty derives both M-implicatures and the relevant embedded implicatures. This principle explains a novel class of implicature, non-convex disjunctive implicatures. These implicatures can be preserved in downward-entailing contexts in the absence of accenting, a property which is predicted by lexical uncertainty, but which violates prior generalizations in the literature [46, 27] In the second part of the thesis, we combine these pragmatic models with another recent probabilistic approach to natural language understanding, exploring the formal pragmatics of communication on a noisy channel. We extend a model of rational communication be- tween a speaker and listener, to allow for the possibility that messages are corrupted by noise. Prosodic stress is modeled as the choice to intentionally reduce the noise rate on a word. We show that the model derives several well-known changes in meaning associ- ated with stress, including exhaustive interpretations, scalar implicature strengthening, the association between stress and disagreement, and the interpretation of the focus-sensitive adverbs. We then show that it can account for several phenomena which are outside of the scope of previous accounts of stress interpretation: the effects of stress on quantifier domain inferences, the intensification of gradable adjective interpretation, and the strengthening of hyperbolic utterances. The account avoids the use of syntactic or semantic representations of stress; the interpretive effects of stress are derived from general-purpose pragmatic rea- soning. 3},

@article{Bower1979,
abstract = {These experiments investigate people's knowledge of routine activities (e.g., eating in a restaurant, visiting a dentist) and how that knowledge is organized and used to understand and remember narrative texts. We use the term script to refer to these action stereotypes. Two studies collected script norms: people described what goes on in detail during familiar activities. They largely agreed on the nature of the characters, props, actions, and the order of the actions. They also agreed on how to segment the low-level action sequences into constituent "scenes," suggesting a hierarchical organization in memory of the activity. Other studies investigated memory for a text narrating actions from a script. Subjects tended to confuse in memory actions that were stated with unstated actions implied by the script. This tendency increased as more related script instances were studied. Subjects also preferred to recall script actions in their familiar order; a scrambled text that presented some script actions out of order tended to be recalled in canonical order. We also investigated whether the reading time for adjacent statements in a text varied with their distance apart in the underlying script. A statement at a one-step distance was read faster than one at a two- or three-step distance; statements in the second half of a script were read faster than those in the first half. A final experiment found that goal-relevant deviations from a script were remembered better than script actions. The role of script knowledge in text memory was discussed, as was the relation of scripts to schema memory in general. {\textcopyright} 1979.},

abstract = {World knowledge enters into pragmatic utterance interpreta- tion in complex ways, and may be defeasible in light of speak- ers' utterances. Yet there is to date a surprising lack of sys- tematic investigation into the role of world knowledge in prag- matic inference. In this paper, we show that a state-of-the-art model of pragmatic interpretation greatly overestimates the in- fluence of world knowledge on the interpretation of utterances like Some of the marbles sank. We extend the model to cap- ture the idea that the listener is uncertain about the background knowledge the speaker is bringing to the conversation. This extension greatly improves model predictions of listeners' in- terpretation and also makes good qualitative predictions about listeners' judgments of how â€˜normal' the world is in light of a speaker's statement. Theoretical and methodological implica- tions are discussed. Keywords:},

abstract = {One of the most astonishing features of human language is its capacity to convey information efficiently in context. Many theories provide informal accounts of communicative inference, yet there have been few successes in making precise, quantitative predictions about pragmatic reasoning. We examined judgments about simple referential communication games, modeling behavior in these games by assuming that speakers attempt to be informative and that listeners use Bayesian inference to recover speakers' intended referents. Our model provides a close, parameter-free fit to human judgments, suggesting that the use of information-theoretic tools to predict pragmatic reasoning may lead to more effective formal models of communication.},

abstract = {Understanding language requires more than the use of fixed conventions and more than decoding combinatorial structure. Instead, comprehenders make exquisitely sensitive inferences about what utterances mean given their knowledge of the speaker, language, and context. Building on developments in game theory and probabilistic modeling, we describe the rational speech act (RSA) framework for pragmatic reasoning. RSA models provide a principled way to formalize inferences about meaning in context; they have been used to make successful quantitative predictions about human behavior in a variety of different tasks and situations, and they explain why complex phenomena, such as hyperbole and vagueness, occur. More generally, they provide a computational framework for integrating linguistic structure, world knowledge, and context in pragmatic language understanding.},

abstract = {Is language understanding a special case of social cognition? To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: Listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to "invert" this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature ("some" implies "not all," and "N" implies "not more than N"). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation. We test these predictions in two experiments and find good fit between model predictions and human judgments.},

abstract = {Most theories of pragmatics and language processing pre- dict that speakers avoid informationally redundant utterances. From a processing standpoint, it remains unclear what happens when listeners encounter such utterances, and how they inter- pret them. We argue that uninformative utterances can trigger pragmatic inferences, which increase utterance utility in line with listener expectations. In this study, we look at utterances that refer to stereotyped event sequences describing common activities (scripts). Literature on processing of event sequences shows that people automatically infer component actions, once a script is â€˜invoked.' We demonstrate that when comprehen- ders encounter utterances describing events that can be eas- ily inferred from prior context, they interpret them as signify- ing that the event conveys new, unstated information.We also suggest that formal models of language comprehension would have difficulty in accurately estimating the predictability or po- tential processing cost incurred by such utterances.
